# Typometer
This is a simple website, which aims to help you check your typing speed. It has a timer, which displays the time(in seconds and deci-second) elapsed, the word count and the characters count. The text area automatically gets disabled after 1 minute. You can again reset and start, using respective buttons. Have a look, share with your friends and compare your typing speed.
